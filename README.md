# JavaScript-projects
These are a few projects I have created using JavaScript:







Calculator: A basic 4 function calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide and a sleek web version of a calculator.

Pizza Menu: This project is a design for an online order menu for a wacky pizza restaurant. It will take the customers input and calculate their order.

Tic Tac Toe Game: Play a classic game of tic tac toe against the computer with funny sounds for winning and losing!

Lightbox Modal: A slideshow that can be clicked through or automatically rolls through slides.
