# JavaScript-projects
These are a few projects I have created using JavaScript. Some will we also feature elements of HTML and CSS.



[Calculator](https://github.com/clcar23/JavaScript-projects/tree/main/Calculator): A basic 4 function calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide and a sleek web version of a calculator.


[Pizza Menu](https://github.com/clcar23/JavaScript-projects/tree/main/Pizza_Project): This project is a design for an online order menu for a wacky pizza restaurant. It will take the customers input and calculate their order.


[Tic Tac Toe Game](https://github.com/clcar23/JavaScript-projects/tree/main/TicTacToe): Play a classic game of tic tac toe against the computer with funny sounds for winning and losing! Includes sounds.


[Lightbox Modal](https://github.com/clcar23/JavaScript-projects/tree/main/Lightbox_Modal): A slideshow that can be clicked through or automatically rolls through slides.
